## **Work Experience**

### **Data Scientist**  
*ANZ, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India*  
**Apr 2025 – Present**  

- Built a simulation engine to estimate resolution times using **workshare concepts**, modeled **resolution time distributions** to predict SLA breaches, and added an **optimization layer** to compute the minimum FTEs required — deployed with **Apache Airflow DAGs** for scalable, reliable execution, reducing SLA breaches by **80%** and achieving **100% automation** in backlog management.  
- Implemented regression using **Bayesian Statistics, Linear Regression, and Time Series models** to accurately predict backlog volume for the next 12 months.  
- Currently working on a **POC using Markov-Chain models** to prioritize a customer’s lifecycle and predict the likelihood and type of next purchase.

### **Data Scientist**  
*Highradius, Hyderabad, Telangana, India*  
**May 2020 – Jan 2025**  
Progressed from **Intern → Associate Software Engineer → Software Engineer (Data Science) → Data Scientist**  

- Developed a **POC for a GenAI-based Agentic AI (RAG) system** to automate parts of invoice dispute handling, including extracting invoice details from emails, classifying dispute types, and querying backend systems (invoices, trade/non-trade promotions) to validate claims.  
- Engineered a **collections optimization module** by collaborating with Product Management, UI, and Platform teams; improved collector SLA performance by **10%** (CPG industry) and operational efficiency by **10%**.  
- Designed **incremental training for Linear Regression** using clustered samples, improving accuracy by **15%**. Developed a **Payment Behavior Classification metric**, boosting prediction accuracy by **12%** with month-boundary-aware modeling.  
- Led a **6-member team** supporting sales initiatives, providing L2 technical support, developing advanced analytical frameworks, and delivering POCs that accelerated client acquisition.  
- Developed a **scalable on-demand deployment architecture** for cost-efficient VM/EC2 provisioning, managing **3,700+ weekly prediction jobs** with datasets of **10M+ records**.  
- Built an **AutoML-ERP endpoint** that dynamically assesses ERP data quality and evaluates forecasting algorithms, reducing modeling timelines by **75%** while improving accuracy.  
- Engineered and deployed **50+ cash flow models** processing 1–6M line items for Fortune 100/500 clients.  
- Conducted **Granger causality hypothesis testing** using Trade Promotion Management data, improving medium-term forecast accuracy by **17%**.  
- Delivered a **POC on Bank Transaction Tagging**, applying TF-IDF vectorization and clustering to categorize major cashflows with ~**90% accuracy**.
